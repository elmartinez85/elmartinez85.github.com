Welcome to my site! I'm Eduardo L. Martinez, a passionate software developer who enjoys
experimenting with new technologies and sharing what I learn along the way.

This blog contains a collection of articles, notes and other technical musings that I've
found interesting. You'll also find links to my projects, contact details and a copy of my
[resume](/resume/).
